## How to Play

Select which mode you want to play in, and press "Start Test".

The default mode is 25 words.

## How I Made It

I started out by using the Catpuccin color palette and defining the basic CSS.

Then, I added basic typing functionality to the game by having an invisible text input that's always in focus.

I also added a text generator which generates text from the top 200 words.

Then, I implemented being able to choose how many words you want.

I also programmed the WPM counter after you finish the test, which was pretty difficult.

I ended off the project with some bugfixes and adding a time based mode.
